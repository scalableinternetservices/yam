## Meet Yam 

Yam is a multiplayer gaming platform. We're beginning 
with two-player 2048, and plan on rapidly adding new features.
Check back soon for the latest and greatest!

Here's what we have coming up soon:

* Two-player 2048 matches between users, with 
  game state managed by the server to prevent cheating
* A match-making system, with multiple selection algorithms
* User profile pages: know thyself and know thy opponent
