## Project Description 

Yam is a multiplayer gaming platform. We're beginning 
with tic-tac-toe, and plan on rapidly adding new features 
Check back soon for the latest and greatest!

Here's what we have planned right now for our core features: 

* Multiplayer tic-tac-toe matches between users, with 
  game state managed by the server to prevent cheating
* A match-making system, allowing random matches, or ones
  selected by player ranking
* User profile pages: know thyself and know thy opponent
