# Two-Player 2048 
Ryan Voong and Ky-Cuong Huynh
18 April 2015


## Playing 

You have two 2048 boards: yours and your opponent's. 
On yours, you use the arrow keys to move the tiles, 
which merge when there are two of the same number. 
On your opponent's board, you'll get to place a 2 or a
4 tile at an open location of your choice. But careful! 
They will do the same every turn to you. 

Play to win on your board. Play to sabotage on your opponent's
board. Get to 2048 first or force your opponent into a dead-end.
Good luck!
